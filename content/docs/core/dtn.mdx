# 🔗 Decentralized Transaction Networks (DTNs)

The **Decentralized Transaction Network (DTN)** is the **orchestrator** that makes multi-chain transactions seamless. Whether you're swapping tokens, bridging assets, or executing complex DeFi strategies, the DTN automates the entire process, ensuring reliability and speed across blockchains.

## 🌟 Key Features of DTNs

### 🚦 **Orchestration for Multi-Chain Operations**
The DTN breaks down complex workflows into **smaller tasks** and executes them in the correct sequence. It ensures each step completes successfully, retrying if needed.

### ⚡ **Optimized Transaction Paths**
By analyzing real-time network conditions, the DTN determines the most efficient routes, saving you time and fees.

### 🛡️ **Error Handling**
With DTNs, you’re protected from common blockchain issues like chain reorganizations, double spends, and fluctuating gas fees.  

### 🔄 **Automation Across Chains**
DTNs transform multi-step processes—like bridging, swapping, and staking—into a **single user request**. No more jumping between DApps.

## 🚀 How DTNs Work: A Step-by-Step Example

### **Scenario: Move and Stake USDC**
Imagine you want to move **USDC from Ethereum to BNB Chain** and stake it, all in one request. Here’s how the DTN makes it happen:

1. **User Request:** You initiate the action via a DApp connected to the Okto Gateway.
2. **Task Creation:** The request is converted into a “job” on the Okto Chain.
3. **Subtask Orchestration:** The DTN breaks the job into smaller subtasks:
   - Bridge USDC from Ethereum to BNB Chain.
   - Swap tokens if needed.
   - Stake USDC on BNB.
4. **Execution:** Each subtask is handled sequentially or in parallel, with retries for failures.
5. **Completion:** Your USDC is staked, and the Okto Chain logs the entire process for transparency.
