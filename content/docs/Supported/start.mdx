## Supported Chains: The Power of Cross-Chain Connectivity 🌉

At Okto, we’ve made it our mission to offer seamless connectivity across multiple blockchains. Whether you're bridging assets, staking, or swapping, our ecosystem supports a range of chains to ensure maximum flexibility and power in your Web3 journey.

### 🌍 Supported Chains Overview

With Okto’s cross-chain capabilities, we support the following blockchain networks:

| **Chain**              | **Type**           | **Use Case**                                           | **Protocol**            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Ethereum**           | Layer 1            | DeFi, NFTs, Smart Contracts, and dApps                | Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) |
| **BNB Chain**          | Layer 1            | DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 gaming                           | EVM-based               |
| **Polygon**            | Layer 2            | Scalable dApps and low-fee transactions               | Optimistic Rollups (POS) |
| **Avalanche**          | Layer 1            | DeFi, high-speed transactions, and cross-chain swaps  | Avalanche Consensus (AVAX) |
| **Solana**             | Layer 1            | High-performance DeFi and NFTs                        | Proof of History (PoH)  |
| **Arbitrum**           | Layer 2            | Faster transactions, low fees                         | Optimistic Rollups      |
| **Fantom**             | Layer 1            | Decentralized applications and high-speed transactions| Lachesis Protocol       |
| **Binance Smart Chain**| Layer 1            | Decentralized finance and low-cost operations         | BSC-based EVM           |

### 🌐 Cross-Chain Abstraction

Through Okto’s abstraction layer, you can interact with all of these chains **seamlessly**. Our system removes the complexity of managing multiple chains, tokens, and transactions.

With a **single request**, you can:

- Bridge assets from **Ethereum** to **BNB Chain** 🛸
- Stake your tokens on **Polygon** and claim rewards on **Avalanche** 🚀
- Swap assets between **Solana** and **Fantom** 🔄

You no longer need to worry about the technicalities of each blockchain’s native gas systems, consensus mechanisms, or transaction structures. Our abstraction layer handles everything in the background so you can focus on your goals. 💼

### 🔐 Supported Cross-Chain Operations:

- **Bridging**: Move tokens between Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Solana, and more!
- **Staking**: Stake your tokens on BNB Chain and Ethereum with a single click.
- **Swapping**: Swap assets with zero hassle across all supported chains.
- **Cross-Chain Asset Management**: Manage your assets through one unified dashboard across multiple chains.

### 🚀 Future Expansions

Stay tuned! Our development team is continuously working to integrate more blockchain networks, giving you even more freedom and access to the decentralized ecosystem. Keep an eye on upcoming announcements for support for **LayerZero**, **Optimism**, **zkSync**, and others.
