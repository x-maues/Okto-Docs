### üîó Token Abstraction and Seamless Interaction

What makes Okto so powerful is our **token abstraction** layer. Here‚Äôs what that means for you:

- **Unified Access to All Tokens**: No need to worry about specific token standards (ERC-20, BEP-20, SPL). With Okto, you can interact with them as if they were all the same.
- **Cross-Chain Token Management**: Transfer, stake, and swap your tokens across **Ethereum**, **BNB Chain**, **Polygon**, **Avalanche**, and more‚Äîall within a few clicks.
- **Interoperable Smart Contracts**: Our ecosystem is built to support **smart contracts** that can interact with any token across multiple blockchains without requiring manual intervention or extensive knowledge of individual blockchain ecosystems.

### üåü Token Use Cases in Okto Ecosystem

- **Bridging**: Move **USDC**, **DAI**, or other assets seamlessly between **Ethereum** and **BNB Chain**.
- **Staking**: Stake **ETH**, **MATIC**, or **AVAX** on their respective networks with Okto‚Äôs streamlined process.
- **Swapping**: Swap **ETH** for **SOL** or **BNB** for **FTM** across supported chains.
