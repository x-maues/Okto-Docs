import { createJob } from 'okto-gateway-sdk';

const jobDetails = {
  action: 'transfer',               // Action to perform
  sourceChain: 'Ethereum',          // Source blockchain (e.g., Ethereum)
  targetChain: 'BNB Chain',         // Target blockchain (e.g., BNB Chain)
  token: 'USDC',                    // Token to transfer
  amount: 1000,                     // Amount of tokens
  destinationAddress: '0x12345...', // Destination address for staking
  actionType: 'stake'               // Type of action (e.g., stake on target chain)
};

const job = createJob(jobDetails);
console.log('Job created successfully:', job);
```
