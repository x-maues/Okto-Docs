# How Okto’s Universal Liquidity Layer Optimizes Cross-Chain Transactions

Bridging assets between different blockchains is a critical operation in Web3. However, ensuring that transactions are fast, cost-efficient, and secure can be challenging. That’s where **Okto's Universal Liquidity Layer (ULL)** comes in.

## What is the ULL?

The **Universal Liquidity Layer (ULL)** is a proprietary feature of Okto that aggregates liquidity from multiple cross-chain solutions (such as LayerZero, Socket, etc.) to find the optimal bridging route for assets.

By analyzing multiple factors—such as **transaction speed**, **security**, and **cost**—ULL ensures that every cross-chain transaction is as efficient as possible.

### Key Benefits of the ULL

- **Best Route Selection**: ULL compares different cross-chain liquidity providers and selects the fastest, cheapest, and most secure route for token bridging.
- **Optimized for Users**: Users don't have to manually select a route or worry about the best chain for their tokens. Okto automatically picks the best route for them.
- **Scalable**: As more blockchains and liquidity sources are integrated into Okto, the ULL will continue to get smarter, offering even better performance.

## Example: Fetching the Best Route

```js
const routeDetails = {
  fromChain: 'Ethereum',
  toChain: 'BNB Chain',
  asset: 'USDC',
};

fetchBestRoute(routeDetails);
