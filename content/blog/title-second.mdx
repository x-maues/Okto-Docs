# Simplifying Cross-Chain Transactions with Okto

Cross-chain operations are often complex, requiring multiple steps and interactions with different blockchains. But Okto simplifies this process into a smooth, unified experience. Hereâ€™s how Okto enables seamless cross-chain token transfers.

## How It Works

Okto utilizes its **Dynamic Transaction Network (DTN)** to orchestrate complex operations like token transfers, staking, and more across multiple blockchains. Whether you're moving tokens from **Ethereum** to **BNB Chain** or executing complex smart contracts, Okto handles the heavy lifting.

### Key Steps in a Cross-Chain Transfer

1. **Submit a Request**: The user specifies the source and destination chains along with the asset to transfer.
2. **Job Creation**: Okto creates a "job" for the requested task.
3. **Transaction Orchestration**: The DTN breaks the job into smaller subtasks and handles each step, from bridging assets to staking them on the destination chain.
4. **Optimized Route**: Okto uses its **Universal Liquidity Layer (ULL)** to find the best, most cost-efficient route for bridging assets.

## Example: Transferring Tokens with Okto

```js
const jobDetails = {
  sourceChain: 'Ethereum',
  destinationChain: 'BNB Chain',
  asset: 'USDC',
  action: 'transfer',
};

createJob(jobDetails);
